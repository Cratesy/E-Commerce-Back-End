## Description

I've been tasked with making a E-commerce back end so that you can update category,products and tags.
I've done this by making use of:

- express.js
- mysql
- sequelize

git clone git@github.com:Cratesy/E-Commerce-Back-End.git
cd E-Commerce-Back-End
npm install
```

As a user, i want to be able to seed my data and schema. I want to be able to see/add/update/delete any of my categorys/products/tags.
